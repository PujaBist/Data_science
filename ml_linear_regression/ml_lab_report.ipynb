    " ##### A text editor is a lightweight tool primarily used for writing and editing code or text. Examples include Notepad++, Sublime Text, or VS Code.\n",
    " ##### An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a more powerful tool that not only allows you to write code but also includes features like debugging, code suggestions, auto-completion, version control integration, and built-in terminal support. Examples include PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and even VS Code when enhanced with extensions.\n",
    "###### So, while a text editor is great for small projects or quick edits, an IDE is better suited for larger projects where development efficiency, debugging, and project management are crucial.\""
